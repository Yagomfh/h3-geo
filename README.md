# Wikiloc-like path using MapBox and DeckGL + animation

In this project I aim at dispalying my latest hike on a map and make a cool animation of the entire journey.

## Tech Stack & Main Modules

**Client:** [Vite React](https://vitejs.dev/), [Material UI](https://mui.com/), [DeckGL](https://deck.gl/), [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/)

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Yagomfh/wikiloc-like-path.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd wikiloc-like-path
```

Run the frontend

```bash
  yarn
  yarn dev
```

## Test it

If you want to use different coordinates for your own project, go ahead and change then in src/data/source.js

You will have to keep the data structure as it is and change the array of coordinates for your own.
